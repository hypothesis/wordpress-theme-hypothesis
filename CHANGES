1.0.0 (2014-10-17)
==================

- Add 'clean' and 'zip' targets to Makefile.
- Put version number from package.json into the theme name and version
  number. It seems best to have it in the name so that multiple versions
  can be uploaded side by side.
- Start release numbering and change logging.
